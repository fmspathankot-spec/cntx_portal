PATCH FOR: app/inventory/nokia-otn/NokiaOTNDashboard.js

ISSUE: When service cards are clicked, selectedCard is set to { card_number: 'ALL' }
This triggers useEffect which calls fetchPorts('ALL'), causing 404 error.

FIX: Update useEffect on lines 30-34

BEFORE:
  // Fetch ports when card selected
  useEffect(() => {
    if (selectedCard) {
      fetchPorts(selectedCard.card_number);
    }
  }, [selectedCard, searchTerm, filterDestination, filterServiceType]);

AFTER:
  // Fetch ports when card selected (but not for 'ALL' - that's handled by service filter)
  useEffect(() => {
    if (selectedCard && selectedCard.card_number !== 'ALL') {
      fetchPorts(selectedCard.card_number);
    }
  }, [selectedCard, searchTerm, filterDestination, filterServiceType]);

EXPLANATION:
- When service cards are clicked, handleServiceCardClick sets selectedCard to 'ALL'
- This should NOT trigger fetchPorts because data is already fetched by fetchAllPortsWithFilter
- Adding condition `selectedCard.card_number !== 'ALL'` prevents the 404 error
